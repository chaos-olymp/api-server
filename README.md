# API-Server

This is a BungeeCord which was especially developed for ChaosOlymp.DE to provide the website frontend with player and server information. It uses the Sun/Oracle http server library to start an HTTP server. The port is hardcoded to port `3010`, but I still recommend putting it behind a reverse proxy like [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) or [haproxy](https://www.haproxy.com/) to ensure more security and professionalism.
